## Understanding Your Report Results

### Student Profile Report
**What You'll Receive:** 3 sections

#### Section 1: Student Overview
| Column | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Student Number** | Unique identifier (matches SEQTA) |
| **Full Name** | First + Last name |
| **Year Level** | Current grade (7-12) |
| **Contact Info** | Parent/guardian phone and email |
| **Total Enrollments** | Number of classes this term |
| **Attendance Rate** | Percentage of days present (target: >90%) |

#### Section 2: Current Classes
| Column | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Class Name** | Subject and section (e.g., "Math 8A") |
| **Subject** | Core subject area |
| **Teacher** | Assigned staff member |
| **Current Grade** | Latest assessment result |
| **Status** | Active / Withdrawn / Completed |

#### Section 3: Recent Attendance
| Column | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Date** | Attendance date |
| **Class** | Which class this attendance record is for |
| **Status** | Present / Absent / Late / Excused |

### Attendance Report
| Column | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|

| **Class** | Subject and section |
| **Teacher** | Staff member who marked attendance |
| **Status** | Present / Absent / Late / Excused |
| **Attendance Rate** | Daily percentage (shown in summary) |

**🚨 Red Flags to Watch For:**
- Attendance rate <85% (chronic absenteeism)
- Multiple "Absent" without "Excused" (unexplained absences)
- Late arrivals >3 times per week (pattern concern)

### Enrollment Summary Report

|--------|---------------|
| **Class Name** | Subject and section |
| **Current Enrollment** | Number of students enrolled |
| **Max Capacity** | Maximum class size |
| **Utilization %** | How full the class is |
| **Status** | Full / Near Capacity / Available / Under-enrolled |

**📈 Capacity Status Guide:**
- **Full (100%):** No seats available
- **Near Capacity (90-99%):** Limited seats
- **Available (50-89%):** Seats available
- **Under-enrolled (<50%):** Consider consolidation

## Tips for Better Reports

### Do's ✅
- **Be specific:** "Attendance for Year 8 on Jan 15" beats "Need attendance data"
- **Provide context:** Helps us prioritize and format appropriately
- **Use student numbers:** Faster lookup than names (especially for common names)
- **Plan ahead:** Request reports 24 hours before meetings when possible
- **Follow up:** If you don't hear back in expected timeframe, send a reminder

### Don'ts ❌
- **Don't request data you don't need:** Respect student privacy
- **Don't share login credentials:** Each staff member should have their own access
- **Don't export to personal devices:** Use school-issued equipment only
- **Don't modify data yourself:** Report errors to ICT for correction
- **Don't assume data is real-time:** Reports reflect last database refresh (typically 4-hour lag for Power BI)

## How to Report Issues

### Data Looks Wrong?
**Email ICT with:**
1. Report type and date generated
2. Specific discrepancy (e.g., "Student shows absent but was in my class")
3. Expected vs. actual values
4. Screenshot if helpful

**Example:**
```
Subject: [DATA ISSUE] - Attendance Discrepancy - Jan 15

Hi ICT Team,

The attendance report for Year 8 on Jan 15 shows:
- Student: John Smith (12345)
- Status: Absent
- Class: Math 8A

However, John was present in my class that day. Can you please verify?

Thanks,
Sarah Johnson
```
